/*
 * Okay, so this thing is going to hold the bam and reference and kdparams
 * Its query is a find_haps method that will take chrom, reg_start, reg_end
 * find_haps will pull the reference sequence (don't always need to...)
 * find_haps will pileup over the regions Â±chunksize min_base_quality=0, truncate=true
 * keep track of the total coverage
 * for read in column.pileups:
 *  if query position is none and read.indel not within sizemin/sizemax --
 *  The bam pileup is a little different.. in rust htslib... so going to have to deal with that
 *  but lets just assume we make it all just fine. No optimizations, just a string of Haplotypes
 * 
 * We'll also need a hap_deduplicate.. though I think that won't be a thing once we refactor
 * And then we got the noreads or no alts and single read stuff
 * Then there's a read cluster - which isn't too bad with a decent kmeans library
 * just gotta work on the consolidate with best
