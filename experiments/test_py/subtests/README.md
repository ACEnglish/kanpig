chr20.isolated_truth.bed
------------------------

Regions where the truth VCF has only one variant within 1kbp.

These are the simplest to compare against


chr20.hets.dissimilar.bed
------------------
Regions where there's just one variant per haplotype (and not isolated)

The two hets must be of different types or more than 95% dissimilar

chr20.hets.similar.bed
------------------
Regions where there's just one variant per haplotype (and not isolated)

The two hets failed to be dissimilar

chr20.split.bed
---------------

This is regions where there are multiple variants on a single haplotype (or both).

These are possibly split

chr20.cpx.bed
-------------
Regions that do not fit any of the other categories.
